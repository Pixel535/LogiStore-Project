# Logistore - Project
The project has been made as a part of Web systems course for Military University of Technology

# Description
The web application will simulate the operation of a warehouse. Users can add, delete, edit and display products in this warehouse. 
In addition, they can likewise add, delete, edit and display warehouse equipment. The warehouse will have a specific capacity and its 'aisles'. 
When adding anything, the user is to specify the quantity of the product in question and where it will be kept. When adding new equipment or editing, 
the user must enter the status of this equipment (so that in the event that it stops working, it is removed from the warehouse). 
In addition, it will be possible to see graphs showing the warehouse - its occupied capacity, the overall status of the equipment, etc.
